Ah, it is hard to speak of what it was, that savage forest, dense and difficult,which even in recall renews my fear: so bitter — death is hardly more severe! But to retell the good discovered there, I’ll also tell the other things I saw. I cannot clearly say how I had entered the wood; I was so full of sleep just at the point where I abandoned the true path. But when I’d reached the bottom of a hill — it rose along the boundary of the valley that had harassed my heart with so much fear — I looked on high and saw its shoulders clothed already by the rays of that same planet which serves to lead men straight along all roads.
